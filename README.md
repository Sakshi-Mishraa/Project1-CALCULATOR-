# Project1-CALCULATOR-
The Calculator is made by me using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. 

Following are the features of the Calculator created by me :
-->It has a text box which accept the expression for calculation and gives the result.
--> It has the digits from 0 to 9 with the operators like Addition(+),Subtraction(-),Multiplication(*),Division(/),Exponential(**) and Equal to (=).
--> WAY OF WRITING THE EXPRESSION IN THE TEXT BOX :
    ~ You can write the expression by clicking on digits and operators OR
    ~ You can write the expression simply by the help of your Keyboard.
--> WAYS OF GENERATING THE RESULT :
    ~ You can generate the result of your expression by clicking the "=" operator OR
    ~ You can generate the result of your expression just by pressing "Enter" key of your keyboard.
--> Further the calculator also has two more options i.e. CLEAR and ERASE.
    ~ CLEAR : This option help you to completely clear your expression written in text box .
    ~ ERASE : This option help you to clear single digit or operator from the expression written in the text box.
    
For styling the CALCULATOR I have used the Box Model properties and Grid Properties of CSS .
